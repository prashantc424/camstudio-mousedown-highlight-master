This is a fork of [CamStudio][1] with an option to only show the mouse highlight when the mouse button is pressed.

My goal is to make screen recordings of the Android emulator look a bit more "touch like".

Here's what it looks like:

The *"Highlight only when button is pressed"* option was added in this fork. The highlight rendering was also modified to make it look better on a dark background.


You can [Download the executable here][2]. You will also need to install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)][3].
